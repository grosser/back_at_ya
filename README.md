 - Flag a Customer for Rewards or Special Offers
 - Store and report on Average Rating Per Customer

### Install

Within your Zendesk account (where you are an admin):

 - Click the gear symbol in the lower left corner
 - Under the Apps menu, select Manage Apps
 - Click on Upload App
 - Upload .zip file as a new App
 - Create Custom User Fields:
 -          agent_satisfaction (text)
 -          agent_satisfaction_average (decimal)
 - Once user fields are created, the app is now live, HOWEVER, you must have tickets in your instance in order to be able to rate them

### After Installation

Rating a Customer for the first time

 - From within a ticket, select a rating (from 1 to 5 stars).
 - Press the eye of the tiger button to keep motivated for extra awesome customer service.

After a Customer has been rated

 - Click a star to choose your rating:
 - 5 = Very Satisfied
 - 1 = Very Dissastisfied

Ratings are stored in the user field agent_satisfaction and rating average is stored in agent_satisfaction_average (for views, triggers, reporting).
Yellow stars represent the average rating by fellow agents. Green stars represent what you have rated this customer on this ticket.
Select “# of Ratings” to see tickets numbers for all ratings this Customer has received.
Use “Agent Satisfaction Average” via Good Data to leverage for reporting
